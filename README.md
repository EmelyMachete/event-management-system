# Event Management System

## Overview
The Event Management System is a web-based application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **C#**, and **SQL** with **Entity Framework Core**. The system is designed to support event planning and management by allowing users to create, view, update, and delete event records through a structured and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates practical backend development skills, including MVC architecture, database integration, and CRUD operations using industry-standard tools.

Event Management System

ASP.NET Core MVC | C# | Entity Framework Core | SQL Server

Overview

The Event Management System is a database-driven web application designed to manage events through a structured and maintainable backend architecture. The system supports creating, viewing, updating, and deleting event records while enforcing data integrity and predictable application behavior.

This project was built to demonstrate sound software engineering fundamentals, including MVC separation of concerns, persistence using Entity Framework Core, and disciplined backend design suitable for enterprise web applications.

Problem Statement

Organizations often require simple internal systems to manage structured data such as events, schedules, or bookings. These systems must ensure correctness, validation, and maintainability rather than visual complexity.

This application addresses that need by providing a clean, server-side managed event system where data consistency and predictable behavior are prioritized.

Core Features

Create, view, edit, and delete events (CRUD)

SQL-backed persistence using Entity Framework Core

Server-side validation to prevent invalid application states

Structured MVC architecture separating concerns across layers

Code-first database migrations

Technology Stack

Language: C#

Framework: ASP.NET Core MVC

ORM: Entity Framework Core

Database: SQL Server

Architecture: Model–View–Controller (MVC)

System Design & Engineering Decisions
MVC Architecture

The application follows the MVC pattern to clearly separate responsibilities:

Models define the domain structure and validation rules

Controllers manage request handling and application flow

Views present data without embedding business logic

This separation improves maintainability, testability, and long-term extensibility.

Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core is used for:

Mapping domain models to relational tables

Managing schema evolution through code-first migrations

Ensuring consistency between application logic and stored data

Server-Side Validation

Validation rules are enforced at the model level to ensure:

Invalid data cannot be persisted

Application state remains consistent

Business rules are respected regardless of client behavior

Assumptions & Limitations

Single-user context (no authentication or role separation)

No external integrations (e.g. email, payments)

Designed for correctness and structure, not high-traffic scalability

UI kept intentionally simple to emphasize backend design

What I Would Improve Next

If this system were extended further, the next logical improvements would include:

User authentication and role-based access control

Audit logging for event changes

Pagination and filtering for large datasets

Deployment configuration for production environments

Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement a stable, maintainable, database-driven web application aligned with enterprise development standards. The focus was placed on correctness, structure, and engineering discipline rather than surface-level features.
